Dynamic Self-Organized maps
===========================

This is a variation of the self-organising map algorithm where the original
time-dependent (learning rate and neighbourhood) learning function is replaced
by a time-invariant one. This allows for on-line and continuous learning on
both static and dynamic data distributions. One of the property of the newly
proposed algorithm is that it does not fit the magnification law and the
achieved vector density is not directly proportional to the density of the
distribution as found in most vector quantisation algorithms. From a biological
point of view, this algorithm sheds light on cortical plasticity seen as a
dynamic and tight coupling between the environment and the model.
